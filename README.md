# python-challenge

# This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

""" This repository contains the PyBank and PyPoll challenges. PyBank is financial data that summarizes a company's monthly operating profit or loss, across 86 months.
PyPoll are votes from an election of approximately 360,000 citizens. The scripts summarize the data and provide results in each Analysis subfolder as 'output.txt'. """

# This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program. However, one section of code in the PyPoll main.py file was provided by an online user.

# The code to re-direct the output to a text file in the PyPoll main.py script was provided by luk32 (https://stackoverflow.com/users/1133179/luk32).
# The original suggestions by luk32 can be found in the stackoverflow thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23364096/how-to-write-output-of-terminal-to-file.
